# VolgaCTF Final

[VolgaCTF Final](https://github.com/VolgaCTF/volgactf-final) is an automatic checking system (ACS) for A/D CTF contests.

It was devised for [VolgaCTF](https://volgactf.ru) competition in 2014 and has been constantly improved over a series of competitions, namely [VolgaCTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf/53) and [CTF.Moscow](https://ctftime.org/ctf/138).

The project was previously known as *Femida Finals* and *Themis Finals*.

This repository contains a docker compose project generator that allows to run the system locally for exploration and development purposes. Refer to [the documentation](generator/README.md) for more details.
